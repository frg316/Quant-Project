# Quant-Project
A project for helping making financial decisions

##Update: Added article stream for tickers.  When tickers are inputted, the application calls the NY Times API to grab articles from the end date entered to two weeks before it.  The articles are clickable links that will bring the user straight to the NY Times page.  Simple Moving Average lines are now functional, with 15 day and 50 day moving averages calculated and plotted accordingly on the graph.  Currently working on cleaning up UI for easier usage.
